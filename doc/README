Intro
-----
EmerCoin is a free open source project derived from Emercoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Emercoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/emercoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/emercoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/emercoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/emercoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 6661 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  EmerCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the EmerCoin network.
